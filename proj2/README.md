Members: Jared Villanueva, Brandon Koh, Andrew Ngi
What code we wrote: We pair-programmed on the entire project.
How well it worked: We were able to stay on the same track consistently.
How we tested: We used the tests provided in the project page and wrote print statements throughout our files to track execution paths
How each group member contributed: We each worked together for a few hours a day, bouncing ideas off of each other to think of solutions.
If more work was needed to be done, we would go home and individually edit without pushing or debug errors in our code then meet up the 
next day to talk about our changes.
